# ML-Linear-Regression

Implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a newoutlet. 
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profi ts and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. 
The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profitt of a food truck in that city. 
A negative value for profit indicates aloss.
The ex1.m script has already been set up to load this data for you.
